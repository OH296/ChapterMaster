# Chapter Master - Adeptus Dominus

**Chapter Master** (aka CM) is a strategy/simulation game, written in **Game Maker Language**, originally designed and developed by Duke.\
This project aims to continue development on the game, fix any bugs, expand and add features.\
**Adeptus Dominus** is just how the team of collaborators calls themselves.

## Building and/or Contributing

There are generally two main ways of working with a **GameMaker** project: through **Visual Studio Code** or through **GameMaker**.

- Working through **GameMaker** may prove to be a pure torture, as their IDE is very bad and the app itself generally has very bad performance, as such generally is not recommended if you plan on working with the code. Only use if you have to.
- The preferred alternative is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Stitch](https://github.com/bscotch/stitch) extension, that is available via the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bscotch.bscotch-stitch-vscode). (huge thanks to guys who made it)

- You can also use any other IDE to work with the code, but you'll have to use one of the above apps to build, as no other building method is available at the moment.
- Other IDEs have no extended support for **GML** and as such generally are not recommended, unless you know what you're doing.

Nonetheless, some things will have to be done through **GameMaker**, even if you use other IDEs, including VSCode, such as: 
- Most of the sprite management.
- Debugging with breakpoints, function steps and realtime debugging are not supported by Stitch at the moment.

### The Visual Studio Code + Stitch way:

0. Download the project, by finding the green "<>Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
   - (Optional) If you want to contribute and know how to use Git/GitHub - fork and/or clone the repository, otherwise check some basic Git guides first.
1. Get the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed, if not already.
   - (Optional) It's recommended to get the Insider version, as it's the most frequently updated one and gets all new features first.
   - (Optional) Get a hang of VSCode by reading some guides on the internet, installing some useful QoL extensions, configuring various settings, etc.
2. Get the Stitch extension installed.
   - (Optional) Watch [this guide video](https://youtu.be/N0wnHauUQjA?si=GPQ22a_LyZq3Y9LP) that covers basic features of **Stitch**, made by its creator.
   - (Optional) Edit various **Stitch** specific settings, to improve your QoL.
   - (Optional) It's recommended to disable "Run in Terminal" **Stitch** option. This will allow you to goto error lines that come up in the output window and custom color output lines. The explanation is in the "Stitch Runner Panel" section on [this page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bscotch.bscotch-stitch-vscode).
3. Press "Ctrl+Shift+P" when in VSCode and write "Stitch Set GameMaker Version", select the option with the same name, in the list, find and set the version to **v2023.11.1.129**. 
4. Run the game by pressing F5 or finding the run button on the **Stitch** panel.
5. Wait for it to download the **GameMaker** version you've selected and build the game.
6. Play the game!
7. (Optional) Read the code, modify it, test, repeat.

### The GameMaker way:
0. Download the project, by finding the green "<>Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
   - (Optional) If you want to contribute and know how to use Git/GitHub - clone the repository, otherwise check some basic Git guides first.
1. Get the [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/) installed.
   - Only version up to 2023.11.1 are working with this project, as of now.
   - Here is a direct link for the **GameMaker** [v2023.11.1.129](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2023.11.1.129.exe), that most of collaborators use at the moment.
2. Find ChapterMaster.yyp in the cloned/downloaded project folder and open it with **GameMaker**.
3. In **GameMaker**, click the Run button or press F5 to build the project and start the game.
4. Play the game!
5. (Optional) Read the code, modify it, test, repeat.
6. (Not Optional) Use any other IDE to work with the code or you'll suffer.

### (Optional) Git Features:

If you are new to Git, then it's recommended to read the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. You only need to read the first 3 chapters to comfortably work with Git, optionally chapter 6 to get more info on GitHub.

If you prefer a more comfortable, graphical user interface based approach to Git, instead of command line, then it's recommended to use one of the options bellow, both are free and popular:
-   [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) + [Tutorials](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials)
-   [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) + [Tutorials](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree)

## Exporting and creating packages

Creating packages (i.e. creating an .exe with the game) and exporting them is allowed for non-commercial use.

Everything else **must** be covered by paid **GameMaker** subscriptions:
